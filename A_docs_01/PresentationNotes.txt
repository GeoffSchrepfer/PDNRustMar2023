Before getting into code, a very brief history of the Rust programming language:
	- Started life circa 2006 as a personal project of Steven Hoare, a developer at Mozilla.
	- Officially announced by Mozilla in 2010.
	- First stable release 1.0 on May 15, 2015.
	- Due to Covid-19, layoffs and other business realities, Mozilla had to abandon support for the project around 2020.
	- The Rust foundation was formed Feb 8 2021 by AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla.
	* (This factoids came from the excellent Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) )

So, what is Rust?
	- A multi-paradigm, high-level, general purpose programming language.
	- Paradigms include concurrent, functional, imperative, and structured, but not object-oriented.

What is it good for?
